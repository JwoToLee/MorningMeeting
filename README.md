# I want a tampermonkey script for edge to scrape some information from this website: https://haesl.gaelenlighten.com/

First I want it to go to a report from this site: https://haesl.gaelenlighten.com/Reporting/ReportingManagement#!/reportRegister/filterSet/9f64d0d2-fcf0-4383-8565-3155f04727ee

Sample report: https://haesl.gaelenlighten.com/Reporting/Report/Index/8e60d8cf-a2f9-4c65-bcc6-152ea09b6df6#!/details

I want it to retrieve a few data:
1. Investigation Stage owner
2. Investigation Target Date
3. QA Follow up stage owner
4. QA Follow up Target Date
